# 2023 Year in Review üóíÔ∏è

As a student and a developer, the past year has been a transformative journey filled with growth, challenges, and accomplishments. It's crazy how I started the year with a near-death experience and here I am holding strong and grateful to be alive. Reflecting on my experiences, I am proud to share my achievements, lessons learned, and my way forward.


## Achievements üéØ

In February of this year, I set a personal goal to spend at least 500 hours coding. To monitor my progress, I installed the WakaTime plugin on my IDE, tracking the hours spent coding on my personal computer.

Throughout the year, I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, honing my skills and expanding my knowledge. Notably, I successfully completed a cross-platform app project that won several grants, showcasing my ability to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios üöÄ. While one of my top goals for the year was to contribute to open source as much as possible, sadly, reality struck, and I didn't make a single contribution to open source.

In the middle of the year, I embarked on a journey to master Data Structures and Algorithms. Though the time commitment wasn't substantial, I can now discuss how data can be efficiently accessed and managed in a distributed system. With my introductory knowledge of DSA, I've been able to solve easy LeetCode problems, participate in technical interviews, and clearly express my thought process on different algorithms.

Also, one challenge I set for myself was to participate in hackathons, and this year I joined 8 hackathons, winning 5 out of the 8, both individually and as a team. My participation in these hackathons gave me the drive and confidence to start building whatever I imagine, no matter how small the steps are.

Internships were also a significant highlight for me. I had 2 paid internships this year and am grateful for the opportunity to be immersed in real-world projects and learn from my teammates at work.

Volunteering was also something I found myself doing, this year I found myself volunteering with The Registra's office at ALU, the financial aid office, TedX ALU and the amazing Developer Students Club where I am a colead and head for web-development.

Oh, and yeah we started a company too! What a year...


## Lessons Learned üìù

The past year has taught me invaluable lessons that extend beyond technical skills. I have come to understand the importance of prioritization, realizing its potential to drive me toward my goals. Moreover, effective collaboration and communication within a team have proven essential for successful project outcomes.

Time management and task prioritization have been crucial in balancing academic commitments and personal projects. I have learned to optimize my productivity and make the most of the limited time available. Additionally, I have embraced the concept of lifelong learning, recognizing the need to stay updated with emerging technologies and industry trends.

## Way Forward

Looking ahead, I am excited to embark on new endeavors and set ambitious goals for the upcoming year. My primary focus will be on expanding my skill set by learning more about DSA and solving LeetCode questions. This will enable me to tackle more complex projects and see how I can contribute to the ever-evolving tech landscape if AI doesn't take our jobs [LOL].

In summary, the past year has been a remarkable journey of growth and self-discovery. I am proud of my achievements, grateful for the people around me and the lessons learned, and excited about the future as a software engineer. With determination and a thirst for knowledge, I am ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

 I appreciate you for taking your time to listen to what I have been up to...
